# Vehicle Sales Dashboard
This interactive Tableau dashboard analyzes sample vehicle sales data, spanning years 2003 to 2005. It focuses on both total and average sales metrics across various product categories, including cars, trains, airplanes, trains, motorcycles, and more.  

## Key Features:  
* **Dynamic Filters**: Users can refine the view by toggling between the total and average, selecting a specific date range, fiscal quarter, deal size (small, medium, large), vehicle type, company, and territory.  
* **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and maps respond dynamically to user interactions. For instance, clicking on a data point (e.g., a specific month on the total sales by month chart) updates all other visualizations to reflect data relevant to that selection.  

This dashboard provides a user-friendly and insightful way to navigate and analyze historical sales data, offering valuable perspectives for decision-making and strategy.
